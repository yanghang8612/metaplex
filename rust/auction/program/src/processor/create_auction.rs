//! Creates a new auction account. This will verify the start time is valid, and that the resource
//! being bid on exists. The creator of the auction by default has authority to modify the auction
//! state, including setting someone else as the auction authority.
//!
//! Possible methods to store bid data.
//!
//! 1) Store the entire bid history in the auction account itself with a list.
//! 2) Use a counter for total number of bids, and use PDAs to store individual bids.
//! 3) Create a ring buffer the size of the winner list, and throw away cancelled bids.
//!
//! For now going with 1 for ease of implementation, will come back to this to figure out cost
//! and/or efficiency of the optoins.
